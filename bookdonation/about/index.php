<p id="about">"Education is important to the success of many people and even entire countries. Unfortunately, 
not everyone can get the education they deserve. Having the funds to pay for such an education is a 
problem in countries across the world. While the cost of a textbook is usually nothing compared to a 
college tuition, it still is a considerable amount of money. Some students may not be able to pay for
all their books. Others may not be able to pay for any books. Some may not be able to pay for any
schooling at all, but wish for books in order to teach themselves. Even if someone cannot pay for a
formal education, a textbook can still be a valuable learning tool on its own. Unfortunately, in 
certain parts of the world textbooks may be hard to come by, let alone pay for. Wealthier students 
are able to buy all of the books they need. Other students are able to buy some books but not others.
Many students who can pay off their education will either keep their textbooks or sell them back to 
a University for a fraction of the price for which they bought them."</p>
